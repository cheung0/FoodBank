# TwitterFood

##What it does
FoodBank is a Twitter bot that sends retweets in real time to all of its followers. So, whenever a food bank tweets that they will be giving out free food and blankets, the Twitter bot will detect that tweet and retweet that message.

##How we built it
We coded in Python and used Tweepy and the Twitter API to build FoodBank.

##Run Instructions
